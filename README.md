Four-letter pHAT Cleep driver for [Piromoni hardware](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/four-letter-phat).

Install python library and render basic events (time). It also implements functions to display text on segments.

## Installation

Solder the 40-pin header and the 2 digits on the board then plug it into your raspberry-pi and install this application on Cleep.

## Configuration

There is nothing to configure. Once app installed hardware is ready to use.

You can use app configuration page to perform some tests.

## Gpios

This hardware uses 2 raspberry pi gpios. See list [here](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/four_letter_phat).
So it is possible to connect other hardware that doesn't need those gpios
